Python Implementation of Reference Electrode Standardization Technique

Reference electrode standardization technique (REST) has been increasingly acknowledged and applied as a re-reference technique to transform an actual multi-channel recording to approximately zero reference ones in electroencephalography/event-related potentials (EEG/ERPs) community around the world in recent years. However, all toolboxes provided by the REST team is either based on MATLAB or in the form of '.exe'. A python implementation of the REST toolbox is lacking. Here, I have therefore developed python function for the REST of scalp EEG. This version of REST is closely related to MNE-python, which is a popular python toolbox for processing the EEG&MEG data. It's designed to provide an easy-to-use for novice researchers and flexibility for experienced researchers. An example of usage is given. I hope the user-friendly REST toolbox could make the relatively novel technique of REST easier to study, especially for applications in various EEG studies.
